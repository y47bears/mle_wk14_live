She\\'s self-motivated -- says she will be studying multi-variate calculus, PDEs, and abstract algebra on her own this summer. She maxed out her high school math curriculum, which included linear algebra as an elective.\\n\\n>Naturally, I asked her about computer science, and she said something like this (paraphrasing):\\n\\n> \"The kids who love computers at my high school seem to be able to spend their entire day focusing on a computer screen, even on weekends. I cannot do that. And those kids are mostly boys whose social behavior is a little bit on the spectrum.\"\\n\\n> While I don\\'t fully agree with her perspective, it makes me wonder how many other talented people shun the field for similar reasons.\\n\\nSample2: \\n\\n> My niece had almost the exact same opinion despite having multiple family members who didn\\'t fit that description, including her mother! It wasn\\'t until I introduced her to some of my younger female co-workers that she committed to being a CS major. She\\'s now a third generation software engineer, which has to be fairly unique.\\n\\n> I\\'ve talked to her about it and she can\\'t really articulate why. I\\'m closer to the nerd stereotype in that I\\'m on the computer a lot but her mother (my sister) definitely is not. I think it\\'s mostly pop and teen culture still harboring the antisocial stigma. I\\'ll have to talk to her some more.\\nThere is probably some connection with video games, in that boys overwhelmingly play games where girls do not. I don\\'t think the games cause the disparity; whatever it is that draws boys to VGs is what draws them to CS as well\\n\\nYou can\\'t blame the field for being unable to fight off stigma imposed by 80-90s movies on an entire generations.\\n\\nFor example, there is no dearth of Indian women in CS. (I think it is similar for Chinese people too). Both societies did not undergo the collective humiliation of nerds that the US went through, and CS is considered a respectable \\'high status\\' field, where people of any personality type can gel in. Thus, women do not face the same kind of intimidation. This is a \"US high school and US culture\" problem. Not a CS problem. \\n\\n> Going on parental leave during a PhD or post-doc usually means the end of an academic career. \\n\\nTo be fair, this is common to almost all academic fields. CS is no exception and I strongly support the having more accommodations for female employees in this regard. \\n\\nHonestly, look at almost all \"high stress, high workload\" jobs and men are over-represented in almost all areas. Additionally, they tend to be a very particular kind of obsessive \"work is life\" kind of men. While women are discouraged form having such an unhealthy social life, men are actively pushed in this direction by society. IMO, we should not be seeking equality by pushing women to abide by male stereotypes. Maybe, if CS became a little better for everyone, it would benefit all kinds of people who are seeking healthier lives, men and women alike.

We need to think much more about this specific problem.   \\n\\n2. Reproducibility is indeed an issue. I honestly don\\'t know why we\\'re in 2020 and machine learning papers can still get away without providing code/trained models. Evaluating the trained model (which is, in the majority of ML related papers, the result) by the reviewers via an open-source system, perhaps like a test-bed specific for applications? For instance, evaluating the robustness of a model on Imagenet. This, of course, should happen along with making code both compulsory and running it as well. This may be a problem for RL related systems, but this doesn\\'t mean we shouldn\\'t even try doing this for any of the submissions.   \\n\\n3. Very true. For some part, it\\'s the responsibility of organizers to not always run after the top 5-6 names, and include younger researchers to help audiences get familiar with a more diverse (and most times, interesting) set of research and ideas. For the other part, it is also up to the researchers to draw the line when they see themselves talking about the same slides at multiple venues over and over again.   \\n\\n4. This specific instance is somewhat debatable. Compared to the level of backlash and toxicity women and people of color receive online is not even close to what he did. Nonetheless, the discussion could be much cleaner.   \\n\\n5. I agree with the first half. I do see companies doing *something* about this, but surely not enough. Also, it\\'s a bit sad/sketchy that most AI research labs do not openly release statistics about their gender/ethnicity distributions. \"People are becoming afraid to engage in fear of being called a racist or sexist, which in turn reinforces the diversity problem. \" There\\'s a very clear difference between \\'engage\\' and \\'tone-police\\'.

Most students/researchers/advisors I know who work on a research project (either via actually leading it or a substantial amount of advising) have no more than 5-6 NeurIPS submissions a year?

This to a large extent enables reddit to be a place where you can voice your thoughts but someone can step in if a situation arises. I remember there was this huge backlash on a recent paper that talked about face detection to identify criminal behaviour. The authors were kind enough to retract their submission. Imagine if they had posted it on arxiv, was there anything anyone could have done about it? \\n\\nb)Set guidelines for arxiv: Imagine you get to review a paper but find out that it is from Geoff Hinton, or Yann LeCun.. would you be able to review it in an unbiased fashion? Maybe the authors could upload a blinded submission to arxiv and reveal the names once a) they decide to stop targetting a publication b) the draft gets accepted.\\n\\nc)Make Codes mandatory: The policy of code-release being optional was largely derived from the systems community where releasing the code meant revealing a lot of properiatary IPs (standard-cell libraries cost billions to model, RTL IP licenses were what earned companies money)..however even they have started gravitating towards open-source (if anyone is interested RISCV, tiny compiler by Austin Henley, JOS by MIT are great starting points) however, AI has started to go the other way, fortunately there are voices speaking out against it.\\n\\nd) Make ethics compulsory: There is this famous quote by Oppenheimer after they invented the Atom bomb: \"I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.\" AI researchers need to understand this quote applies a lot to them. \\nThe Atom Bomb killed around 126K people (lowest estimate) in a matter of minutes..Prior to that, if someone had to kill around 126K people, they would need an army that was at least twice that size and would need to fight for at least 20 months (US lost around 6,600 people a month during the war). \\nSimilarly, research that took around months/years can now be done in minutes/days. This is a tremendous amount of power and people who wield it can shape our future. It is thus important to focus on the \"ethics\" of AI rather than look at pure accuracy numbers.\\n\\ne) Better metrics: Increasingly there are models that are able to beat SOTA due to their sheer size. Take BERT for example, Do you think colleges in Africa, Asia would be able to afford the compute costs? How about we rank models based on cost (in terms of power consumed, in terms of money ) and not just based on accuracy?. \\n\\nf) While I might disagree with \"some\" of the language used by Gebru. She has a point. In an increasingly competitive world, if we choose not to stand up for those who do not have a voice, we are choosing to ignore their views and are complicit in silencing them. PhDs are toxic and cutthroat and AI research is even more so. My girlfriend was forced to walk out of a project for speaking out against harassment because the harasser was \"intelligent\". If people like Gebru are silenced, people like my girlfriend are the ones who will have to pay the price. I would highly recommend watching the documentary called \"disclosure\" on netflix to understand the consequences of ignoring someone\\'s perspective. If Gebru hadn\\'t spoken out against racism and the danger of facial recognition algorithms, we would still be having companies like clearview.ai mining our data for surveillance. \\n\\ng) Understand privilege: This is something ALL AI (and Security) researchers need to understand. If you are a researcher publishing one or two papers in AI (or Security), you have some degree of privilege. Think about what you need to know to be a decent AI researcher today: A fair deal of programming, linear algebra, probability, good vocabulary, free time to keep up with deluge of papers in your field, a good peer group to discuss and brainstorm ideas, and finally resources to conduct experiments. ALL of this is privilege. So when someone is trying to point out an issue, maybe we can listen.. and yes, sometimes the issue may not be presented correctly or the person might use language that we cannot stomach.

Ideally, the framework would have some compute behind it (maybe like Google Colab) so that all the models and code submitted can be run directly in the conference/journal submission page - imagine that: reviewers being able to interactively test people\\'s models rather than going off of nothing but cherry-picked samples.\\n\\n> **Thirdly,** there is a *worshiping* problem. \\n\\nThat\\'s probably true, although I can\\'t speak too much about it, as I\\'m not very involved in the politics of academic research. That being said, all enterprises will inevitably involve some icky politics and favoritism. The best we can do to combat that is make things as transparent as possible.\\n\\n> **Fourthly**, ... *toxicity*\\n\\n This problem goes far being ML/AI research - it has pretty much pervaded throughout all of public discourse at this point. We can discuss the problem of \"toxicity\" in general, which I would chalk up to our culture having not quite come to terms with the fundamentally different way we have to process information in the information age. However, overall I think AI research (and science in general) does a better job than most areas on that front.\\n\\n> **Fifthly**, ... a huge *diversity problem* \\n\\nI completely agree, and there are plenty of arguments for why we and all of academia has a diversity problem. You are probably familiar with most, and we don\\'t have to get into them, but suffice to say, once again, our cultural and traditional biases and institutions conflict with a more contemporary mentality. What do we do about it? Outreach and transparency - they are slow but they work.\\n\\n> **Sixthly**, moral and ethics are set *arbitrarily* \\n\\nThe problem here is a little unclear to me? Is it that people use technology in ways other people don\\'t like? That seems inevitable. Is it that Western culture undervalues the rest of the world? What else is new? Don\\'t get dragged down with the American Exceptionalists in denial as the US heads for economic and social stagnation and decline.\\n\\n> **Seventhly**, there is a cut-throat publish-or-perish *mentality*.  \\n\\nComing from physics research, I agree that the AI field has a dangerously strong publish-or-perish mentality. However, that also means the field is highly dynamic and garners lots of interest/funding. I\\'m not convinced that a field as closely intertwined with engineering and the private sector does not actually benefit from a shorter project cycle. Additionally, the barrier to entry is virtually non-existent (unlike most other sciences where researchers won\\'t give you the time of day if you don\\'t already have a PhD, and the equipment/expertise necessary for making progress precludes anyone outside of 2-3 groups on Earth from publishing on your topic).\\n\\n> **Finally**, discussions have become *disrespectful*. \\n\\nAgain, that\\'s really just a misunderstanding for the way information works in the information age. Attention is a commodity and insulting people still has a high rate of return. This will change for the better as we get a handle on how to process information in this brave new world (especially in informal settings like social media).\\n\\nThanks for the points though - it does us well to think critically about not just the \"what\" in research but also the \"how\" and \"why\".',\n",

The fact that peer-review suffers as a result is bad, and it has been raised and discussed many times but no one yet has a solution. The fact is that we don\\'t currently have a system that both allows for fast dissemination of research and a blind review process. That it has not been fixed is not for the lack of attention or trying.\\n\\n>Secondly, there is a reproducibility crisis.\\n\\nSecondly, what does this have to do with toxicity? \\n\\n>Papers that do not beat the current state-of-the-art method have a zero chance of getting accepted at a good conference.\\n\\nThis is patently false, and one of many instances of hyperbole in this post.\\n\\nPeople have been discussing a \"reproducability crisis\" in ML, but... where is it? The BERT-class models in ML have been consistently reproduced. To my knowledge the best vision models have similarly had their results reproduced too. Where there\\'s an unreproducable result, it\\'s either been called out and the author responds, or without a response it\\'s taken as an unreproducable result that\\'s ignored. The biggest reproducability problem has to do with access to data and computational resources, but that\\'s by no means the same \"reproducability crisis\" in other fields.\\n\\n>Thirdly, there is a worshiping problem. Every paper with a Stanford or DeepMind affiliation gets praised like a breakthrough.\\n\\nMore hyperbole.\\n\\n>BERT has seven times more citations than ULMfit\\n\\nIt also performs a lot better than ULMFiT. I say this as someone who thinks ULMFiT doesn\\'t get enough spotlight in the LM->encoder sphere. ELMo also basically disappeared overnight because of BERT.\\n\\n>Next, Bengio, Hinton, and LeCun are truly deep learning pioneers but calling them the \"godfathers\" of AI is insane. It has reached the level of a cult.\\n\\nCan you explain, in concrete terms, how using an analogy of \"godfather\" (which I take in the meaning of a founding leading, rather than from the mafia) is \"insane\" and \"has reached the level of a cult\"? Or is that just hyperbole?\\n\\n>Fourthly, the way Yann LeCun talked about biases and fairness topics was insensitive. However, the toxicity and backlash that he received are beyond any reasonable quantity.\\n\\nThis is the first actual mention of toxicity, and very obviously the trigger for you to rant about the field.\\n\\n>Fifthly, machine learning, and computer science in general, have a huge diversity problem. \\n\\nLet may state this first, and upfront, that while this problem is not unique to ML and CS, it is still an important problem that needs to be addressed. That said, it has nothing to do with toxicity (or specifically, not in the way you\\'re talking about. You\\'re not, for example, talking about how toxicity makes ML less diverse, you\\'re in fact arguing the opposite) and it sounds like just another point to pad out your list of complaints, until:\\n\\n>this lack of diversity is often abused as an excuse to shield certain people from any form of criticism. Reducing every negative comment in a scientific discussion to race and gender creates a toxic environment. People are becoming afraid to engage in fear of being called a racist or sexist, which in turn reinforces the diversity problem.\\n\\nI have no idea what on earth you are talking about, or where you are getting into these sort of discussions.\\n\\n>Sixthly, moral and ethics are set arbitrarily.

At this very moment, thousands of Uyghurs are put into concentration camps based on computer vision algorithms invented by this community, and nobody seems even remotely to care. \\n\\nYou\\'ve just described... the Internet in general.

If you don\\'t publish 5+ NeurIPS/ICML papers per year, you are a looser.\\n\\nI have never seen someone publicly called a loser for not publishing sufficiently. I\\'m sure it\\'s happened in specific groups, but it is not generally considered acceptable by the community.

Is that the not clearest possible example of \"toxicity\" you are arguing against?\\n\\n----\\n\\nThe field is not without its problems, for sure. There are many issues of accessibility, diversity, and dissemination of information that need to be addressed. Most of it has to do with how quickly the field has grown, and the institutions and even social conventions that have not yet adjusted to accommodate its new size and prominence (too many qualified students, too many papers, too many new results). A related part of it is the potential misuse of the technology that we\\'re building and researching. And for all the negativity and online arguments that have gotten of hand, one of the best parts of the field is that a lot of this is done in public, with free communication, and a lot of genuine self-criticism. Ask almost anyone in the field and they would agree that we are not doing enough to address all of these problems, even if we don\\'t yet agree on how we can do better.\\n\\nPosting a big list of unrelated, hyperbolic complaints stemming from cherry-picked examples (How many labs have PIs who don\\'t know all their PhD students?

Ultimately, this creates what I call the \"wall of shame\" for papers that  have been rejected, making it difficult for graduate students and  researchers to overcome the bad reviews received -- and this is made  worse b/c the reviewers are kept anonymous and thus not held accountable  to their poor reviews).\\n\\nUltimately,  what has been created in the field in many ways is what I have called  for many years the \"deep learning rat race\", where accomplishments are  often just outperforming a benchmark by a percentage point or two.   Furthermore, the review process is not being held to higher standards  (often attributed to the increasing deluge of submissions that place a  tremendous burden on reviewers and conference staff), leading to  situations where some actually reject a paper and then \"copy\" the idea  for themselves (with no citation at minimum -- again, the \"credit  assignment\" problem as noted above) in their own work (and if the copier  comes from a prestigious lab, the original source/proposer gets  overshadowed since they do not have the prestige of name that comes with  Stanford or Mila, for example).\\n\\nI  could go on further and add plenty of details and \"war stories\" to  accompany some of the issues I have raised above (and this does not even  address the many other problems pointed out in the OP\\'s post). But, in  essence, I think that what the machine learning community, at large, really needs is a drastic \"culture change\" across all levels (ranging from the  newcomers to the famous/established) addressing problems that plague the  field such as \"publish or perish\" and \"idea plagiarism\" (prominent in  the famous/big labs especially) as well as reviewing quality in  conferences.I often find much better reviewing (in general, there  are exceptions) in journals as opposed to conferences, where at least  the researcher is given reasonable and useful constructive feedback that  can be used to improve the paper and address issues in the work (if  they are addressable). Conferences have, especially recently, become a  disappointment for me, more than usual, given that the reviewers will  not even read the rebuttals me and my students carefully craft to abide  by the very strong constraints on word/character limits while still  addressing issues from reviewers that are actually address clearly in  the very text of the paper (of course, this assumes reviewers read the  whole paper -- which is unlikely, given that so their plate is quite  full with many, many reviews overall). Until we induce a deep cultural  shift in the field of machine learning and truly address its \"old boys\\'  club\" like scheme (where only those coming from the prestige get their  work recognized), the field will only progress more slowly.\\n\\nI  will mention though (for fellow professors that share my silent agony),  that part of this change comes from within our own labs. While it is slow  and more challenging to change our institutions, instilling a strong and  healthy culture and set of practices in one\\'s own lab is key to  inducing the cultural shift I wish would happen across the field  globally. If you hold your students to rigor and credit assignment,  build lab comradery (starting by knowing the names of your students, at  the very minimum) and supporting your students whenever you face often  cruel and unethical rejections, and never let your own work slip due to  the many frustrations and issues from the field, I believe your lab can  contribute to a brighter future.',\n",
